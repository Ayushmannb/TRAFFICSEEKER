# TrafficWatch

TrafficWatch, a packet sniffer tool, allows you to monitor and analyze network traffic from PCAP files. It provides insights into various network protocols and can help with network troubleshooting, security analysis, and more.

## Features

- Protocol-specific packet analysis for ARP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, DHCP, HTTP, SNMP, LLMNR, and NetBIOS.
- Packet filtering based on protocol, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and more.
- Summary statistics on captured packets.
- Interactive mode for in-depth packet inspection.
- Timestamps for each captured packet.
- User-friendly colored output for improved readability.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scapy
- argparse
- pyshark
- colorama

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/HalilDeniz/TrafficWatch.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd TrafficWatch
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

   ```shell
 python3 trafficwatch.py --help
usage: trafficwatch.py [-h] -f FILE [-p {ARP,ICMP,TCP,UDP,DNS,DHCP,HTTP,SNMP,LLMNR,NetBIOS}] [-c COUNT]

Packet Sniffer Tool

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Path to the .pcap file to analyze
  -p {ARP,ICMP,TCP,UDP,DNS,DHCP,HTTP,SNMP,LLMNR,NetBIOS}, --protocol {ARP,ICMP,TCP,UDP,DNS,DHCP,HTTP,SNMP,LLMNR,NetBIOS}
                        Filter by specific protocol
  -c COUNT, --count COUNT
                        Number of packets to display

   ```


To analyze packets from a PCAP file, use the following command:

```bash
python trafficwatch.py -f path/to/your.pcap
```

To specify a protocol filter (e.g., HTTP) and limit the number of displayed packets (e.g., 10), use:

```bash
python trafficwatch.py -f path/to/your.pcap -p HTTP -c 10
```

### Options

- `-f` or `--file`: Path to the PCAP file for analysis.
- `-p` or `--protocol`: Filter packets by protocol (ARP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, DHCP, HTTP, SNMP, LLMNR, NetBIOS).
- `-c` or `--count`: Limit the number of displayed packets.
